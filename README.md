## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

There's not much going on here at the moment, it's a work in progress.

I guess I'll be using this space as my online portfolio. A place to put any temporary projects I'm working on, a place to link to projects or documents that I may use if needing to show others my work, etc.

### Me?

Well, there's not really much I can say about myself. 
I'm a huge geek, love all things computer and techy related. Currently working as a support associate for a software company, studying part time through the [Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/) for my degree in Computing & IT Software Engineering.

In my spare time I seek out as much information and knowledge on a range of subjects.

I'm trying to learn Game Development with Unity, Unreal Engine and C# as well as picking up some learning material on Java, SQL, networking and some network penetration testing. 
There's so much out there that is fascinating, and I want to get an understanding of as much as I can.
I I've also loved the coding side of things ever since a
friend first introduced me to the world of Pascal in DOS. Have been hooked ever since and I have some limited experience with Pascal, Delphi, C++ and Visual Basic

### Current Projects (Works in progress)

Currently working through an online Java course, then looking to expand on this with app development with Java and Kotlin.

Also going to be going through the course again, looking at all the challenges and exercises and uploading my results of those challenges. While they're not great pieces of code, they're a good resource to go back on and look at my own progression.
