## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

This is s a work in progress, but I guess it's time for an update, as it has been a while.

As an experienced IT professional with over 7 years in technical support, I’ve developed extensive expertise in modern IT environments. My journey began in 1995 with building PCs and configuring home networks, and has evolved to include a robust understanding of virtualization technologies such as Hyper-V, VMware ESXi & Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Proxmox.

I earned a Diploma of Higher Education in Computing & IT in 2023 and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree. Alongside this, I hold a BTL1 Level 1 cybersecurity certification, and I am undertaking the SOC100 cybersecurity certification. Recently, I’ve embraced Linux as my daily operating system, utilizing VMs on bare-metal setups and cloud VPS to host open-source applications and explore containerization with Docker.

I continually seek to expand my knowledge through platforms like Try Hack Me, Hack The Box, and Blue Team Labs Online. I am also developing a home SOC lab, enhancing my skills in Windows and Linux system installation and administration, including advanced configurations with Windows Server and Group Policy Objects (GPO).

Driven by a passion for continuous learning and improvement, I am committed to leveraging my technical expertise to innovate and solve complex IT challenges. I thrive in collaborative environments and am eager to contribute to forward-thinking teams.
